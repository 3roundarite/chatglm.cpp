- Performance-based: BICSI 002 defines the performance requirements and objectives for data centers, rather than prescribing specific solutions or technologies. This allows data center designers to choose the most suitable and cost-effective options for their projects.
- Scalable: BICSI 002 supports the scalability of data centers, both horizontally and vertically. It provides guidance on how to design data centers that can accommodate future growth and changes in demand, without compromising the quality or reliability of service.
- Reliable: BICSI 002 ensures the reliability of data centers by addressing the potential sources of failure and disruption, such as power outages, cooling failures, fire incidents, security breaches, human errors, and natural disasters. It also provides recommendations on how to implement backup systems, redundancy levels, fault tolerance, and resilience strategies.
- Secure: BICSI 002 protects the security of data centers by addressing the physical and logical threats that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data and systems. It also provides recommendations on how to implement security policies, procedures, controls, and audits.
- Efficient: BICSI 002 promotes the efficiency of data centers by addressing the energy consumption and environmental impact of data centers. It also provides recommendations on how to implement energy-saving measures, green initiatives, and sustainability practices.
