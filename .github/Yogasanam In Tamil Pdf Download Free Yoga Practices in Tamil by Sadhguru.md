## What is Yogasanam?
 
Yogasanam is a Tamil word that means "yoga posture" or "yoga pose". It refers to the physical exercises that are part of the yoga system. Yogasanam can be classified into different types, such as standing poses, sitting poses, twisting poses, bending poses, balancing poses, inverted poses, and relaxation poses.
 
Each yogasanam has a specific name and a specific effect on the body and mind. For example, tadasanam (mountain pose) is a standing pose that helps you improve your posture and alignment. Paschimottanasanam (seated forward bend) is a sitting pose that stretches your hamstrings and lower back. Matsyendrasanam (spinal twist) is a twisting pose that massages your internal organs and stimulates your digestion. Bhujangasanam (cobra pose) is a bending pose that strengthens your spine and chest. Vrikshasanam (tree pose) is a balancing pose that enhances your stability and focus. Sarvangasanam (shoulder stand) is an inverted pose that boosts your blood circulation and immunity. Savasanam (corpse pose) is a relaxation pose that calms your nervous system and releases tension.
