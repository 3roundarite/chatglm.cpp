4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 is based on the latest BIM technology and an AutoCAD-like look and feel, making it easy for CAD users to switch to BIM and fire fighting software. Users can create their BIM project in 2D or 3D using very simple 2D commands like polylines, trim, extend, entity snaps and copy. They can also import a 2D DWG drawing of the floor plan to use it as a background and focus on the fire fighting installation.
 
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 provides engineers with all the essential tools for the design and calculation of sophisticated fire fighting networks. It enables the automated calculation for all the widely known standards like EN 12845, NFPA 13, FM GLOBAL, CEA 4001, AS 2118, BS 9251 and others. It also allows users to define custom parameters and criteria for their specific projects.
 
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 produces files directly in DWG format and includes features to convert the sophisticated BIM objects that can't be seen in CAD software into simple vectors that can be further edited in AutoCADÂ®. It also offers unrivalled compatibility with other BIM applications like Revit, Archicad etc., as well as seamless integration with other FINE-MEP verticals like FINEHVAC, FINESANITARY etc.
 
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 is a powerful BIM software for fire fighting design that offers high productivity features for only a fraction of the price of its main competitors. It is available for download as a free trial version from [4M website](https://4msa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=158&lang=en). For more information, please contact [Mintronics](https://www.mintronics.co.uk/finefire), the official distributor of 4M products in the UK.
  
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 is not only a design and calculation software, but also a simulation and analysis tool that allows users to test and optimize their fire fighting systems. Users can perform hydraulic calculations, pressure loss calculations, pump selection, pipe sizing, sprinkler head placement, nozzle flow calculations and more. They can also visualize the results in 2D or 3D views, generate graphs and charts, and export the data to Excel or PDF formats.
 
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 also includes a comprehensive library of fire fighting components and equipment from various manufacturers and standards. Users can easily select and insert the components they need from the library, or create their own custom components and add them to the library. The library is constantly updated with new products and features.
 
4M FINE FIRE 14.0.0.0 is a user-friendly and flexible software that can adapt to any project size and complexity. Users can work on multiple projects simultaneously, create different scenarios and alternatives, compare and evaluate different solutions, and generate reports for each one. They can also customize the software settings, preferences, units, languages, symbols, layers, styles and more.
