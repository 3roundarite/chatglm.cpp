Ekk Deewana Tha is a 2012 Hindi movie directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, starring Prateik Babbar, Amy Jackson and Manu Rishi in lead roles. The movie is a remake of Menon's own Tamil/Telugu bilingual film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa/Ye Maaya Chesave, which was a blockbuster hit in both languages. The movie features music by A.R. Rahman, who also composed for the original versions.
 
The movie tells the story of Sachin Kulkarni (Prateik Babbar), a mechanical engineering student who dreams of becoming a filmmaker. He falls in love with Jessie Thekekuttu (Amy Jackson), a Malayali Christian girl who lives in the same building as him. Jessie belongs to a conservative family that is opposed to inter-religious marriages. Sachin tries to woo Jessie, who initially rejects him but later develops feelings for him. However, their relationship faces many hurdles due to their different backgrounds and beliefs.
