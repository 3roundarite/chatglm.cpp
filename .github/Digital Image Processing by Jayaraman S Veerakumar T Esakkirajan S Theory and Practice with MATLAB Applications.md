One of the main features of the book is its illustrative approach, which uses numerous figures, tables and diagrams to explain the concepts and techniques of image processing. The book also provides several practical examples and case studies to demonstrate the applications of image processing in various domains such as face recognition, fingerprint recognition, iris recognition, license plate recognition, medical image analysis, satellite image analysis and more.
 
Another feature of the book is its MATLAB applications, which are given at the end of each chapter. These applications help the readers to implement the algorithms and methods discussed in the book using MATLAB, a popular software tool for numerical computation and visualization. The MATLAB code and images used in the book are also available online for download.
 
The book is written in a simple and lucid style that makes it easy to read and understand. The authors have used a logical and systematic approach to present the topics and have avoided unnecessary mathematical details and derivations. The book also contains review questions, multiple choice questions and exercises at the end of each chapter to test the readers' comprehension and reinforce their learning.
