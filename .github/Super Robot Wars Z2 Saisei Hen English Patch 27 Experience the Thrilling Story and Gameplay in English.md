- Use the Data Link feature to import your save data from Hakai Hen. This will give you a lot of bonuses, such as extra PP, kills, money, and items. You can also choose which route you followed in Hakai Hen, which will affect some of the events and characters in Saisei Hen.
- Pay attention to the SR points and the hidden conditions for each stage. SR points are special objectives that reward you with more PP and money if you complete them. Hidden conditions are optional tasks that unlock secret units, characters, or events. You can find a list of SR points and hidden conditions in various guides online[^1^].
- Customize your units and pilots according to your preferences and needs. You can use PP to buy skills, upgrades, parts, and abilities for your units and pilots. You can also use Custom Bonuses to further enhance your units' performance. Experiment with different combinations and find what works best for you.
- Use Support Attacks and Defends wisely. Support Attacks allow you to attack with another unit when you attack or counterattack an enemy. Support Defends allow you to defend with another unit when you are attacked or counterattacked by an enemy. These actions consume SP and EN, but they can be very useful in dealing more damage or avoiding damage.
- Save often and use multiple save slots. The game can be challenging at times, especially if you are aiming for SR points or hidden conditions. You might encounter unexpected situations or make mistakes that could cost you the stage or the game. Saving often and using multiple save slots will allow you to retry or change your strategy if needed.
